I THINK THIS GOT MY ACCOUNT BANNED use at your own risk.
I plan to use this at startup, and get free games.

For use modify the email and password fields in the code, very easy to spot them. (Has to be used with chromedriver)
To run at startUp silently schedule the HideBat.vbs no browser or console will pop up
